# PCB-Footprints-Library
A curated library of professionally designed PCB footprints for electronic components that lack reliable or IPC-compliant land patterns in standard EDA libraries. All footprints are created from manufacturer datasheets, verified for manufacturability, and intended for real-world production use.
